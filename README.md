# Giphy-Project

Attempted to build working GIPHY API

Supposed to add to an array of already set buttons that would show gifs of Marvel, Pixar, and Video Games, but it did not show up, nor could I get other buttons or gifs to show up.

Struggled with this assigment, since I was trying to go back and re-learn past assignments while learning the current.

## What this project does
This project is meant to display giphys using API calls from the Giphy site. 

## Why is this project useful
The Giphy API project is useful because it teaches us how to make API calls to display the Giphys on our site.
